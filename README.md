to me 



















Hi Kevin,
 
As discussed, you will be required to complete their company’s programming assessment task, which forms the basis of your application to REA Group. They shall take your submission very seriously (using this to assess your programming competency level, skills and style), so please put your best foot forward.
 
The test that you will need to complete:
 1. IMPORTANT: Toy Robot Test. They are looking for top quality code. Basically… impress them! The problem is attached and you will be required to do this in Ruby 

Please read the instructions carefully, and in great detail, before commencing.
 
 Notes for the Robot Test:
 • Ensure that you utilise TDD; there must be decent test coverage
• Object orientation must be implemented. For instance, if you decide to create position and state machine objects, which is desirable, the robot class should be a robot as well as an input file parser and a robot controller.
• Your position and state machine objects should follow desirable patterns in software development (eg, immutable patterns)
• Ensure there are no bugs; ie, the test doesn’t fail!
• Please ensure the code works as specified
• Ensure that the tests are not very complex or hard to read 
• Ensure you attempt to model the domain
• Avoid having multiple assertions per test 
• Make sure the solution appears to be test driven 
• Avoid code duplications
• Don’t over complicate the production code – it’s a simple problem. 

Should the test results be satisfactory, you will be required to come in for an interview, part of which will cover the answers to your code solutions (and relate to the pair programing task). As such, please put in your best effort when completing the tests.
 
I’ll see you around 12.15 tomorrow.
 
Please contact me should you have any further questions, or any issues.
 
Cheers,

Code problem details:

 

­­­­­­­­­­­

Toy Robot Simulator

 

Description:

. The application is a simulation of a toy robot moving on a square tabletop,

of dimensions 5 units x 5 units.

. There are no other obstructions on the table surface.

. The robot is free to roam around the surface of the table, but must be

prevented from falling to destruction. Any movement

that would result in the robot falling from the table must be prevented,

however further valid movement commands must still

be allowed.

 

 

. Create an application that can read in commands of the following form ­

PLACE X,Y,F

MOVE

LEFT

RIGHT

REPORT

 

. PLACE will put the toy robot on the table in position X,Y and facing

NORTH, SOUTH, EAST or WEST.

. The origin (0,0) can be considered to be the SOUTH WEST most corner.

. The first valid command to the robot is a PLACE command, after that, any

sequence of commands may be issued, in any order, including another

PLACE command. The application should discard all commands in the

sequence until a valid PLACE command has been executed.

. MOVE will move the toy robot one unit forward in the direction it is currently

facing.

. LEFT and RIGHT will rotate the robot 90 degrees in the specified direction

without changing the position of the robot.

. REPORT will announce the X,Y and F of the robot. This can be in any form,

but standard output is sufficient.

 

. A robot that is not on the table can choose the ignore the MOVE, LEFT,

RIGHT and REPORT commands.

. Input can be from a file, or from standard input, as the developer chooses.

. Provide test data to exercise the application.

 

 

Constraints:

The toy robot must not fall off the table during movement. This also includes

the initial placement of the toy robot.

Any move that would cause the robot to fall must be ignored.

 

Example Input and Output:

a)

PLACE 0,0,NORTH

MOVE

REPORT

Output: 0,1,NORTH

 

b)

PLACE 0,0,NORTH

LEFT

REPORT

Output: 0,0,WEST

 

c)

PLACE 1,2,EAST

MOVE

MOVE

LEFT

MOVE

REPORT

Output: 3,3,NORTH

 

 

Deliverables:

The Ruby source files, the test data and any test code.

It is not required to provide any graphical output showing the movement of

the toy robot.
